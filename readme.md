## What does `ocwd` do?
`ocwd` is a command line utility that downloads resources at bulk from any [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/) course to any storage path provided by you, with just one key press! 

The resources are available under the creative commons license and MIT reserves all rights to the content. This tool simply scrapes the OCW website for resources and offers a simple and easy way for downloading any course resource for offline use.
## Installation Guide
### Without using PowerShell
#### üêß Linux + üçé macOS
Paste the following to your terminal:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ocwd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amkhrjee/ocwd/main/ocwd.sh && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ocwd)"
```

This simply copies the `ocwd.sh` file to your `/usr/local/bin/` directory. Now you can use `ocwd` from any directory in your system.

<hr>

### Using PowerShell
#### ü™ü Windows
`ocwd` works with both [Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7.3) and the cross-platform [PowerShell-Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.3). 

All recent versions of Windows 10 & 11 already come with Windows PowerShell installed (search for `PowerShell` using Windows Search to find out whether you have it or not). However, you can also follow the installation guides provided here in case you don't have PowerShell installed.

 <h3>PowerShell Installation Guide for Windows</h3> 
</summary>
PowerShell comes in two flavours - PowerShell Windows and PowerShell-Core. You are recommened to download PS-Core, as it is the one in active development by Microsoft and thus have the latest features. `ocwd` downloads work faster with PS-Core (thanks to multi-threading!)

### Windows PowerShell Installation Guide

Windows PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that is included with Windows by default. Here is a guide to install Windows PowerShell:

1. Check if Windows PowerShell is already installed on your system. To do this, open the Start menu and search for "PowerShell". If PowerShell is installed, you should see it listed in the search results.

- Once the download is complete, open the installer file and follow the prompts to install WMF on your system. This will install Windows PowerShell on your system.

3. Once the installation is complete, you can launch Windows PowerShell by opening the Start menu and searching for "PowerShell".

4. To verify that Windows PowerShell has been installed correctly, you can run the following command:

If you have PowerShell installed, we can proceed to install `ocwd`.

`ocwd` is currently available via Microsoft's [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ocwd/2.5.0). If you have installed external scripts before, you can skip to the installation script, otherwise, open PowerShell in Administrator Mode and paste the following in order: 

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
```ps1
Set-PSRepository -Name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
```
This will install `ocwd` to your system:
```ps1
Install-Script -Name ocwd
```

After the installation is over, you are suggested to close and reopen your terminal for reloading the shell.



## Usage
There are two ways to use `ocwd`:
```ps1
ocwd your_link_here
```
or just type in the command:
```ps1
ocwd
```
